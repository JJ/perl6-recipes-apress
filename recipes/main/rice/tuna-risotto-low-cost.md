# Tuna risotto

A relatively simple version of this rich, creamy dish of Italian origin.

## Ingredients (for 4 persons)

* 320g canned tuna
* 250g rice
* ½ onion
* 250g whatever cheese is in your fridge
* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* 4 cloves garlic
* 1 spoon butter or margarine.
* ⅓ wine or beer.

## Preparation

1. Slightly fry tuna with its own oil it until it browns a bit. You can
 do this while you start doing the rest. Save a bit of oil for the rice.
1. Stir-fry garlic until golden-colored, chopped if you so like, retire if
 you don't like the color.
2. Add finely-chopped onion, and stir-fly until transparent.
3. Add rice and stir-fry until grains become transparent in the tips.
4. Add wine or beer and stir until it's absorbed by grains.
5. Repeat several times: add fish broth, stir, until water is evaporated
, until rice is soft but a bit chewy.
6. Add tuna, butter, grated cheese, and turn heating off, removing until
 creamy. 
7. Let it rest for 5 minutes before serving.
