# Tuna risotto

A relatively simple version of this rich, creamy dish of Italian origin.

## Ingredients (for 4 persons)

* 250g tuna
* 250g rice (carnaroli or arborio)
* ½ onion
* 125g cheese (parmegiano reggiano, granapadano or manchego)
* 1 tbsp olive oil (extra virgin)
* 4 cloves garlic
* ½ liter fish broth (or fumé)
* 1 cup white wine
* 2 spoons butter

## Preparation (75m)

1. Chop tuna to small chunks, and stir-fry it until it browns a bit; you can do this while you start doing the rest.
1. Stir-fry garlic until golden-colored, chopped if you so like, retire if you don't like the color.
2. Add finely-chopped onion, and stir-fly until transparent.
3. Add rice and stir-fry until grains become transparent in the tips.
4. Add wine and stir until it's absorbed by grains.
5. Repeat several times: add fish broth, stir, until water is evaporated, until rice is soft but a bit chewy.
6. Add tuna, butter, grated cheese, and turn heating off, removing until creamy.
5. Let it rest for 5 minutes before serving.
